Pipeline by ellisrichardj for continual updating of lineage specific trees from a given pathogen WGS dataset.

Building phylogenetic trees from large WGS data sets can be both time consuming and compute intensive. This pipeline creates muliple smaller data sets for each defined lineage in a population and thereby produces mutiple smaller trees of the most closely related samples.
